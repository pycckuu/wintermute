description: Orchestrate the full Wintermute development lifecycle for a task.

Follow the workflow defined in `dev/skills/implement-wintermute-task.md`.
Read that file now and execute it.

Do not skip mandatory phases, agents, or verification gates.
Do not mark the task complete without the required evidence block.
Enforce test placement policy: tests only under `tests/`, mirroring `src/`; never place tests in `src/`.
